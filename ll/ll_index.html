		<h1>How It Works</h1>
		<p>While we most of our clients come to us to maintain their stringed
			instruments, our true passion is making custom guitars and basses.
			Whether you're looking for an acoustic to play by the campfire, an 
			electric guitar to shred, or a Flamenco guitar for a change of pace,
			we've got you covered.</p>

		<p>After you place your order, one of our luthiers will review all the
			details with you to ensure you'll getting exactly what you want
			before we start creating your instrument.</p>

		<p>Once we've begun the build process, you can keep track of its status
			using our online progress tracker.  We'll even post pictures along
			the way, so you can see your instrument take shape before your 
			eyes!</p>

		<p>And for all of you southpaws out there, we have you covered.  Our
			master luthier knows the pain of dealing with limited selection all
			too well, so every instrument we make can be made for a righty or
			lefty.</p>

		<p>Finally, we'll tune, set-up, and restring any instrument we make
			for free for the lifetime of the instrument, and provide a discount
			on repairs should it be damaged.</p>

		<h3>Ready to get started?</h3>

		<p><a href="ll_order.html">Well let's do it to it!</a></p>

		<h3>Want to see some of our work in action?</h3>
		<p>Well you can either come to our Baymeadows location, or watch this
			<a href="ll_rawk.html">music video</a> from a local Jacksonville 
			band, Burden Affinity, as they show off some of our work.</p>
